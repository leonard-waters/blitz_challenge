# BlitzChallenge

  - Add your `RIOT_API_KEY` to the `.env` file and then `source .env` in terminal
  - Run via `mix run --no-halt`

# Notes:

- definitely needs more test coverage
- lots of areas to make it more clean and user friendly
  - started on this with a more colorful console input, but it was a time suck
- a handful of TODOs listed that I might take on later
- needs considerably better/cleaner error handling
